# Engineering Projects and Portfolio — AI • Data • ML • Full-Stack 

Welcome to my engineering portfolio, a curated collection of projects demonstrating my skills across AI Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and Frontend/Backend development. This repo serves as a central hub containing multiple sub-repositories (via Git submodules), each representing a real-world, production-oriented project.

# Repository Structure
## 🧠 AI Engineering

Projects focused on building intelligent systems using modern LLMs and AI frameworks.
Includes RAG systems, embeddings pipelines, model serving, and LLM-powered applications.
End-to-end ML workflows covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and experimentation.
Showcases classical ML, deep learning, and reproducible pipelines.

## 🛠️ Data Engineering

Scalable ETL/ELT pipelines built with tools like Airflow, Spark, Kafka, and cloud data services.
Demonstrates orchestration, automation, and data workflow design.

## 📊 Data Analytics

Business-focused analytics using SQL, visualization, and dashboarding.
Highlights insights-driven problem solving and data storytelling.

## 💻 Frontend & Backend

Full-stack engineering projects using React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and FastAPI/Node.
Focuses on building user interfaces and APIs that integrate with AI systems.

# 🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to:
- Present my work in a clean, structured, and easy-to-navigate format
- Demonstrate technical range: AI → ML → Data → Full-stack
- Showcase real-world, production-style engineering
- Provide recruiters and collaborators with a quick overview of my strongest skills
- Centralize my projects into one professional hub
